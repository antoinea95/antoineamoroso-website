        "content": "This project is a tool for creating Kanban boards and managing projects. It allows users to organize tasks visually using boards, lists, and cards, making it easier to track progress and collaborate effectively. I developed this clone using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, React, and Firebase to enhance the quality of my code and improve my TypeScript skills. I utilized React Query to manage requests to Firebase and created a class to avoid code repetition for subscribing to the database, among other functionalities. Additionally, I employed Zod and React Hook Form to manage forms and validate data, and React Router for seamless navigation within the application."
